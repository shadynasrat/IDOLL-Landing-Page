In May, Thessaloniki is a vibrant city with a palpable buzz, as locals and students start hanging out in Navarinou Square, sipping coffee and tsipouro, and filling the rooftop bars as they begin to open for the season. The average high temperature is 24\u00b0C (75\u00b0F), making it warm enough to visit the beach, with the famous turquoise waters of the Halkidiki Peninsula just a 2-3 hour bus ride away.\n\nAdditionally, Thessaloniki has a rich history, with Roman monuments, interesting churches, and stalls selling koulouri (pretzel-like sesame rings). The waterfront is a wonderful place to stroll or cycle, and the city's iconic White Tower is a must-visit attraction.\n\nOverall, Thessaloniki offers a great combination of culture, history, and natural beauty, making it an excellent choice for a city break in May 2025."

This ancient city feels young at heart, with a palpable buzz that moves outside in May when locals start hanging out in Navarinou Square, sipping strong coffee and tsipouro (grape brandy) at pavement caf\u00e9s, and filling the rooftop bars as they begin to open for the season. With average highs of 24\u00b0C (75\u00b0F), it's even warm enough to pop to the beach: Blue Flag Epanomi is only 25km (15 miles) south, and the famed turquoise waters of the Halkidiki Peninsula are a 2-hour bus journey away.\"\n\nIf you're looking for alternative options, you might also consider visiting Thessaloniki's neighborhoods, such as Egnatia, built on a Roman road, which is the main thoroughfare; around it are Roman monuments (including the ruined palace and Arch of Galerius), interesting churches, and stalls selling koulouri (pretzel-like sesame rings). The waterfront, home to the city's iconic White Tower, is a wonderful place to stroll or cycle.\n\nHowever, if you're interested in exploring other destinations, you might also consider visiting Barbados, which is a great destination for surfing, with top spots for catching waves including Freights Bay (good for beginners), South Point, and Soup Bowl. Alternatively, you could visit Uluru in Australia, which is a unique and spiritual destination that's perfect for those interested in nature and culture."
